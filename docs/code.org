All the SQL code is in =sql/=.

The SQLite adapter is implemented in =db.sqlite.scm=.

The ~#!sql"path/to/file.sql"~ reader syntax is implemented in
=sql-reader-syntax/sql-reader-syntax.scm=.

DB adapters should consist of two "layers": one that mimics directly the
DB schema operations (adding, removing, listing, etc); and another to be used
from the outside that checks invariants and stuff.

Since all DB adapters will use the same underlying DB schema, the exported
procedures should have the same names and try to show the same behaviour.
